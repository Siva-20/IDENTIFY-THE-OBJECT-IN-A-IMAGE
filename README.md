What is ML(Mchine Learning)?
                    Machine learning(ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. In a Simple Word, Machine learning is humans try to mimic human brain by computer programs…Make computers think like humans. We are gonna develop a system that can think like humans.

When it comes to building a machine learning system, we can build it in two ways.
                    1.We can code it by ourselves
                    2.We can use other’s code to build a ML system.
        
In this Project build by using API is called, Clarifai.
